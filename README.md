# Temporal Difference Learning Algorithms for Cliff Walking Environment

<p align="center"><img src="images/cliff.png" width = "256" height = "256"></p>

This is my implementation of the following Temporal Difference (model-free) Learning Algorithms:

- Sarsamax (Q-learning)
- Sarsa-zero
- Expected Sarsa 

for Cliff Walking Environment using Python & OpenAI gym's **cliff walking** environment.
OpenAI's main code for how the game environment works can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/cliffwalking.py).
